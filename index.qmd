# Welcome to Mathematical Statistics! {.unnumbered}

This book contains the course notes for *MATH/STAT 455:* *Mathematical Statistics* at Macalester College, as taught by Prof. [Taylor Okonek](https://taylorokonek.github.io/). These notes draw from course notes created by Prof. [Kelsey Grinde](https://kegrinde.github.io/), and heavily from the course textbook, *An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications* by Richard Larsen and Morris Marx (6th Edition). Each chapter will contain (at a minimum):

1.  Learning Objectives

2.  Reading Guide

3.  Definitions

4.  Theorems

5.  Worked Examples

**I will be editing and adding to these notes throughout Spring 2024, so please check consistently for updates!**
